<h2>This is Methodic Onion</h2>
<p>Hosted with GitHub Pages, this is my projects showcase site. It will still be a while before I get any real projects up and running, but I intend to use this space to shocase all my newest and most exciting projects. For when the day does come that there's more than a launch page, there will be links below which direct you to the most abstract level of description by which I will be posting my stuff.</p>
